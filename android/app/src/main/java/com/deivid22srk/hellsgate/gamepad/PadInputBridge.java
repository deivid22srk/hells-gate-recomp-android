/**
 * Java -> native bridge for the on-screen virtual gamepad.
 *
 * The natives live in libmain.so (android_gamepad.cpp) and drive an SDL3
 * VIRTUAL gamepad: SDL routes every state change through the standard
 * gamepad event pipeline, the runtime's SDL input driver picks it up like
 * any physical controller (SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_ADDED), and the recompiled
 * game reads it through its regular XInput API. No SDK code is touched.
 *
 * Button indices mirror SDL3's SDL_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_* order 1:1: the native
 * virtual gamepad declares exactly these 16 buttons in this order, so these
 * constants ARE the SDL button indices. Axis handling lives in the native
 * side (SDL half-axis semantics for triggers, full range for sticks).
 *
 * Every method is safe to call at any time from the UI thread: before the
 * native side is attached (or if libmain.so failed to load) they are no-ops.
 *
 * ATTACH POLICY: the virtual gamepad is attached by the native side
 * (dantes::gamepad::EnsureVirtualPadAttached, called from android_main right
 * after the runtime app OnInitialize, i.e. after the SDK input driver has
 * installed its event watch). Java MUST NOT attach earlier: a premature
 * SDL_EVENT_GAMEPAD_ADDED would fire before the driver's watch exists and
 * the pad would never be opened.
